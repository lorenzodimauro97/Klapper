# Klapper
Klapper is a free, open-source and not Vue-based Klipper web interface for managing your 3d printer.

# Why
Because I don't know Vue and I really don't want to learn it. Also want to get my hands dirty on Blazor.

# What's the end goal here?
The idea is to implement everything Fluidd and Moonraker has, and some more!

# How to run?
You need to install the .NET 6 Runtime on your Windows / Linux system and do all the necessary steps (Google is your friend), but I'll eventually find a way to automate this process.
